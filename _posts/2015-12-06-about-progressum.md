# About PROGRESSUM ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3dc6cb62-1227-4e6b-a882-0e78380d5f0a.jpg)

Our strength is our staff, we make sure to always incorporate experiences from all of our team members throughout our work processes and projects. This ensures high quality and efficiency in terms of both results and working procedures. 

The aim of PROGRESSUM is to create effective and efficient working procedures that will decrease the cost for you at the same time as the quality of our services are increased.

PROGRESSUM does not only provide consultancy services, we also conduct our own work within relevant fields. A example of this work is the currently ongoing project: "Cost of Elections (CoE)". The CoE project aims to map the costs related to electoral process worldwide. The final product of the CoE project will be an interactive online database where the user will find verified data concerning the conduct of electoral processes from all over the world.
